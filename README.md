# In-silico Medicine with Simulink
In silico medicine is the use of computational models and simulations to develop medical devices and pharmaceuticals. These simulation models aim to replicate the anatomy, physiology, and biological processes of the human body. Therefore, you can use in silico medicine to validate designs and clinically evaluate new medical devices and pharmaceuticals.

In this repository, you will find the slides presented during the second session of the MAPTA MATLAB Seminar Series.
